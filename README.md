Implementation of the RANSAC algorithm for circle detection, written for the pattern recognition course.

---

Original assignment description:

Make a program in C, C++, C#, Java, or Java script, that does the following.

1. Convert the configurations of figure 1.5 and 1.6 of Small into 2D point sets.

2. Detect circles by using RANSAC (see slides, and also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC)

3. Of the RANSAC "support set" of these circles, determine a covering annulus, or better, compute the real smallest width annulus (via the (Fartherst) Voronoi Diagram) of the point set.

4. Compute the covering probability Q(n), expected number of annuli E(N), and thickness of the annulus.

5. Based on the above criteria, find a few strongest circular configurations.
