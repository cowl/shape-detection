Implementation of the RANSAC algorithm for circle detection, written for the pattern recognition course.

---

Original assignment description:

Make a program in C, C++, C#, Java, or Java script, that does the following.
1. Convert the configurations of figure 1.5 and 1.6 of Small into 2D point sets.
2. Detect circles by using RANSAC (see slides, and also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC)
3. Of the RANSAC "support set" of these circles, determine a covering annulus, or better, compute the real smallest width annulus (via the (Fartherst) Voronoi Diagram) of the point set.
4. Compute the covering probability Q(n), expected number of annuli E(N), and thickness of the annulus.
5. Based on the above criteria, find a few strongest circular configurations.

Good web-based implementations will be put on the course website. Submit an executable, program sources, and a report to Remco Veltkamp on CD or DVD no later than at the written exam. Put your names and studentnumbers in the report. In addition, the report must contain the following.
1. A description of how the program works.
2. A short description of the methods implemented.
3. Illustrations that show the correct working of the program.
